Since QAppImageUpdate is specifically made for Qt, All you need is Qt's development tools
and only that, Nothing more and nothing less.

## Dependencies

* [Qt5 Framework](https://qt.io)


## Optional Dependencies (Specifically for Torrent Update Feature)

* [Torrent Rasterbar](https://libtorrent.org)


Using the torrent feature is strictly for brave hearts because it's a bit hard 
to get everything linked and compiled correctly. Please don't try this if don't
know what you are doing. For reference you can see how [AppImage Updater](https://github.com/antony-jr/AppImageUpdater)
 compiles it.

## Installing the latest release from github

**Just execute this command on your project folder and everything will be done for you!**   
You must have **git** to do this , **don't worry** because most of the linux distro's must   
have **installed it already** for you , if not install it!

```
 $ git clone https://github.com/antony-jr/QAppImageUpdate
```

or **to install it in your git project folder**

```
 $ git submodule init
 $ git submodule add https://github.com/antony-jr/QAppImageUpdate
 $ git submodule update
```

Even though AppImage is specific to linux, this library is cross platform.


## Installing to the system

```
 $ git clone https://github.com/antony-jr/QAppImageUpdate
 $ cd QAppImageUpdate
 $ cmake .
 $ make -j$(nproc)
 $ sudo make install
```

Now you can use QAppImage with CMake's **find_package()**.
